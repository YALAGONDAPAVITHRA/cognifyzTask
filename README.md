# cognifyzTask
Here’s a brief explanation of the four machine learning tasks in the internship:

TASK-1. Predict Restaurant Ratings

Build a regression model to predict a restaurant’s rating based on other features.

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, split data).

Train a regression algorithm like Linear Regression or Decision Tree Regression.

Evaluate using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

Analyze which features influence ratings the most.

TASK-2. Restaurant Recommendation System

Create a recommendation system based on user preferences.

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).

Define recommendation criteria (e.g., cuisine preference, price range).

Use a content-based filtering approach to suggest restaurants.

Test with sample user inputs and assess recommendation quality.

TASK-3. Cuisine Classification

Build a classification model to categorize restaurants by cuisine.

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train a classifier like Logistic Regression or Random Forest.

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Analyze performance across different cuisines and detect biases.

TASK-4. Location-based Analysis

Perform geographical analysis of restaurant locations.

Visualize restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude.

Group by city/locality and analyze concentration patterns.

Compute statistics like average ratings, cuisines, and price ranges per area.

Identify insights or trends related to restaurant locations.
These tasks involve data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and insights extraction, offering hands-on ML experience.
